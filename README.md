# GoCheck
GoCheck a blazingly fastâ„¢ alternative to Matterpreter's [DefenderCheck](https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck) which identifies the exact bytes that Windows Defender AV by feeding byte slices to `MpCmdRun.exe`

## Usage
```cmd
$ gocheck check --help
Usage:
  gocheck check [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --amsi          Use AMSI to scan the binary
  -d, --defender      Use Windows Defender to scan the binary
  -f, --file string   Binary to check
  -h, --help          help for check

```

### Evasion Usage
Usage of `gocheck` to identify bad bytes, and pass the offset into [ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) (or, any other decompiler) to hopefully decompile the binary and identify the bad bytes in a function.

I'll be using `ghidra` to decompile the binary and identify the bad bytes in a function since I'm more familiar with it. (and, it's free)
#### 1. Check for Bad Bytes
```cmd
$ gocheck <file> /optional:args
```

* Identified bad bytes at offset **0x9DD** (from start of binary)
* 16 bytes **before & after** the bad bytes are also printed for context, but doesn't help much in this case.

#### 2. Open the binary in Ghidra
* Navigation -> Go To... -> **FILE ( 0x9DD )**
  * Alternatively, `G` also brings up the same dialog.

* The bad bytes are identified after a call to `VirtualAlloc` and before a call to `VirtualProtect` in this case, which should be easy to find in the artifact kit.

## Installation
You can install `gocheck` from `go install`
```bash
go install github.com/gatariee/gocheck@latest
```

Alternatively, you can download the precompiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/gatariee/gocheck/releases) or build it yourself.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gatariee/gocheck
make [ windows / win64 / win32 ]
```
